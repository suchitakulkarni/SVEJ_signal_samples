The repository corresponds to model presented in arXiv:2511.02918
The repository contains two folders 
1) A pythia card for simulating SVEJ signal without madgraph in directory Pythia_cards_no_mg5
2) A sample events for three different lambda values as generated using MadGraph + Pythia setup in Pythia_plus_mg5_setup

It is recommended to start from the Pythia_cards_no_mg5 to check how the signal looks like and later on move to setup with MadGraph.

MadGraph matching, merging should be carefully checked.
